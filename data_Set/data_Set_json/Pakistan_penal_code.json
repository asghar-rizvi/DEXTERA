It signifies a direct, physical connection \u2013 like a hallway or doorway \u2013 between the outhouse/building and the main house.

Opening a locked door, while potentially illegal, does not inherently compromise the structure's integrity in the same way that creating a hole through a wall does, which directly breaches the property\u2019s defenses."

A 'shajjah-i-munaqqilah' results in a fifteen percent fine, a 'shajjah-i-ammah' a one-third fine, and a 'shajjah-i-damighah' a one-half fine. This highlights the importance of classifying the type of injury."

When combined with 'jurh,' it allows for imprisonment terms of up to ten years (for other types of 'jurh') or fourteen years (specifically for 'shajjah-i-damighah').

The amount of 'arsh' – fifteen percent, one-third, or one-half – is determined by the type of 'shajjah' and the severity of the wound, reflecting the legal system's approach to compensating victims of harm."
