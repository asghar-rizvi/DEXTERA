Admission sought to be the basis of decree was in fact qualified admission of an official of the defendant and inter-departmental communications which would not amount to conceding plaintiff's claim. Any admission as contemplated by O.XII, R. 6, C.P.C. has to be unequivocal admission which could amount to estoppel against the party making such admission. Defendant had yet to file written statement while application in terms of O.XII. R. 6, C.P.C. had been filed before defendants had submitted their written statement. Plaintiffs were thus, not entitled to decree on basis of qualified admission in terms of O.XII, R. 6, C.P.C.8"

        "answer": "The definition states that a person is considered acquainted with another’s handwriting if they have seen the person write, received documents allegedly written by them in response to one’s own documents, or habitually received documents purporting to be written by that person in their business dealings."

        "answer": "The definition identifies three ways to be considered acquainted with another's handwriting: witnessing the person write, receiving documents purportedly written by them in response to one's own, and habitually receiving documents from that person in a business context."

        "question": "What is the significance of ‘purporting to be written’ in the context of determining acquaintance with handwriting?",
        "answer": "The term ‘purporting to be written’ is crucial because it indicates that the document’s authenticity is not definitively confirmed. It signifies that the document is presented as being written by the individual, but its genuine origin has not been independently verified."

      {
        "question": "How does the definition differentiate between simply observing someone write and truly being considered acquainted with their handwriting?",
        "answer": "Simply observing someone write is not enough to establish acquaintance; the definition requires additional evidence, namely, the receipt of documents or habitual exposure to documents ostensibly written by the person in question. This distinguishes passive observation from a genuine connection established through document exchange."

This habitual submission provides a strong indication of familiarity and acquaintance, moving beyond a single instance of seeing someone write."

        "question": "What legal principle is illustrated by the scenario described, and what outcome is typically associated with it?",
        "answer": "The scenario demonstrates the principle of 'estoppel,' which prevents A from denying the validity of the sale if he intentionally misled B into believing he had ownership rights. Therefore, A cannot successfully argue that he lacked title at the time of the sale."

        "question": "If A had not intentionally misled B, would he have been able to set aside the sale?",
        "answer": "No, if A had acted in good faith and without intentionally deceiving B, he would likely have been able to set aside the sale. The crucial element is the deliberate misrepresentation by A that caused B to purchase the land."

        "question": "What is the significance of B's purchase of the land in this legal context?",
        "answer": "B’s purchase is critical because it signifies that he relied on A’s misrepresentation. This reliance acts as evidence that the sale was valid, and A cannot subsequently attempt to invalidate it based on claims of lacking title at the time."
